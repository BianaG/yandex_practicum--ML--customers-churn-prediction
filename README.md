# yandex_practicum-customers-churn-prediction
The customers of the bank are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. In this project, we need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon or not. We will build a model with the maximum possible F1 score - at least 0.59, and also measure the AUC-ROC metric.

The libraries and modules that had being used in this project are as follows:
1. pandas
2. sidetable
3. numpy
4. matplotlib.pyplot
5. seaborn
6. sklearn.model_selection
7. sklearn.metrics
8. sklearn.preprocessing
9. sklearn.dummy
10. sklearn.utils
11. sklearn.linear_model
12. sklearn.tree
13. sklearn.ensemble
